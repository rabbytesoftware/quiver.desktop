//! The desktop process's open-file limit.
//!
//! macOS starts a GUI app at launchd's soft limit of 256 open files. Go raises its
//! own soft limit to the hard limit at startup — which is why quiver.core runs at
//! thousands of descriptors without complaint — but Rust does no such thing, so
//! the app is left at 256 unless it asks for more.
//!
//! That is a real ceiling here, not a theoretical one. Every call the frontend
//! makes reaches quiver.core as a unix-socket connection owned by *this* process
//! (`connection::local::transport`), and the two event streams in
//! `connection::ws` hold a socket each for the life of the app, redialling every
//! 500ms whenever the daemon is not up yet. So the app's descriptor use tracks
//! the frontend's traffic and the daemon's availability, not its own modest
//! needs. Once the ceiling is reached, `connect()` fails with `EMFILE`, which
//! `HttpClient::health` cannot tell apart from a daemon that never started — so
//! the app reports the backend as down when the fault is entirely local.

/// as generous.
